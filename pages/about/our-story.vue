                          Christ Co-workers fellowship started in 1978. It
                          operated one branch in Nairobi and several others in
                          upcountry towns. Later, the one branch at the City
                          center was split after the completion of the Chrisco
                          Multi-purpose Center at Woodley to Central church and
                          Chrisco City Church based at the City Center. Chrisco
                          City Church was conceived in a Chrisco National
                          Advisory Team meeting, which was held at the mission
                          home in August 1992, under the able leadership of our
                          spiritual parents, the departed Apostle Harry Das and
                          Mama Cora Das.

                          It was resolved that, after the Chrisco Multipurpose
                          Centre (which was under construction in Woodley),
                          would be completed, the Central Church (that was then
                          congregating at Nairobi Cinema Theatre) would relocate
                          there and another congregation be established to
                          continue congregating at the Nairobi Cinema. In that
                          meeting, several names for the new congregation were
                          floated but we settled on City Church. City church was
                          birthed on 20th June 1993 when the Central Church
                          moved into the multipurpose centre even before the
                          construction was completed.

                          requested us to sponsor a congregation he was starting
                          at KICC. We sent Elder Bernard Wainaina and his wife,
                          Esther, to become pastor of the congregation. A few
                          deacons including Peter Musisi, some deaconesses and
                          other workers, were released to go and help there. In
                          1995, we sent Elder Paul Chomba and his wife Beatrice
                          to take over pastoring of the Kayole congregation from
                          Pastor Otaala and his wife Dorothy, who were returning
                          to Uganda. In 2000, we sent Elders, then in training,
                          Ezekiel Nyaga and his wife Jennifer to the KICC
                          branch, Ephantus Muiruri and his wife Jane to the

                          In August 1996, the management of Nairobi cinema was
                          transferred to a new group led by individuals hostile
                          to the Church of Christ. They imposed unbearable
                          conditions on us, leading to the decision to move part
                          of the congregation to the University of Nairobi Main
                          campus on 22nd September 1996, while the other part
                          remained under Pastor Isaac Kiragu until Nairobi
                          Cinema was closed down for renovations. This marked
                          the birth of the New Life congregation.

                          Friday evening that the University of Nairobi
                          administration would no longer allow their facilities
                          to be used for religious purposes. In response, we
                          found a temporary solution by moving to the 8th floor
                          above our offices in Contrust house along Moi Avenue

                          property in Kitisuru. For us, Kitisuru is our
                          'Gilgal,' reminiscent of the biblical place where the
                          Israelites built a memorial monument to commemorate
                          God's miracles and victories. It is a strategic place
                          for us to reflect on our journey and plan for the
                          future - a place of going back to fundamental basics.
