### Minimal Project Documentation

Look at the [Nuxt 3 documentation](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/introduction) to learn more.


### Development environment
```bash
NuxtJs: Version 3
Node Version: 16.20.1 - Also declared in .nvmrc
Operating System: Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS - Might be useful if symlinks don't work or file paths are invalid
```

## Setup

Change node version to the project's node version

```bash
nvm install # install the required node version if not already installed
nvm use # run this in the root directory to switch node versions
npm install # install npm dependencies
 ```

## Development Server

Start the development server on `http://localhost:3000`:

```bash
# npm
npm run dev
```

## Production

Build the application for production:

```bash
# npm
npm run build
```

Locally preview production build:

```bash
# npm
npm run preview
```

## Deploy 

```bash
git add . # if you added new files
git commit -m "Briefly describe the new changes made here"
git push # sync the changes with the master branch in this repository. This will also trigger a deployment on Netlify reflecting the changes you made to the repository 
```
